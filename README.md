# A few lines of R

> My goal for this project is to hold all the R snippets I come across that might be helpful to future me. 

Sometimes all you need are a few lines of R to solve a problem. Often when I am struggling with R it is because I overlooked, or forgot, how R works. I spend several minutes searching the usual spots (StackOverflow, GitHub, package documentation) before I remember. My goal for this project is to hold all the code snippets I come across that might be helpful to future me. Maybe they'll be useful for others too. 


## Contribute

Please feel free to contribute to this project. Surely there are many, many useful bits of R code out there that I'll never think to add. 

To contribute simply add markdown files to the proper folders in the **snippets** folder of this repo. If the folder doesn't exist feel free to add it. 

Right now the following YAML header is required to all markdown files. Please make the title descriptive. The collection should be the same as the folder you put the file in.

```yaml
---
title:
experience:
collection:
---
```

Experience is the difficulty of the snippet you'll be writing about. It should be one of **basic, intermediate, advanced, tip**. Any experience level that may be written that isn't in this list will be converted to **tip**. 

### New to GitHub

If you would like to add a code snippet but are intimidated by GitHub please create a new issue by clicking Issues tab above, then the green New Issue button. Be as complete as possible while describing your code snippet.

If there any further question feel free to email me.

## Inspiration

I recently stubmled upon [1loc.dev](https://1loc.dev) and figured I could build a resource like this for R. Thanks @phuoc-ng for the inspiration.
